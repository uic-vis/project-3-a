## Data Set Description

### Data Set Information
Using Divvy bike data from July 1st to July 8th 2022([https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data]). It has 157959 entries


Processed the data using Pandas in python. In doing this I added and removed columns. Additionally, the data was filtered to only contain dates from July 1st to July 8th so that the data could be uploaded to observable. I then pulled the json from my observable notebook (https://observablehq.com/@angelica-v/project-2) that contained any addiontal filtering I ceated.
